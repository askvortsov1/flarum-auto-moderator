      about_trust_levels_text: |
        Trust levels allow you to automatically manage group membership based on users' activity.<br></br>
        Each trust level defines criteria that must be met (e.g. discussions started, posts made, etc), and a group.<br></br>
        Users are automatically added to groups for all the trust levels that they qualify for when they log in.<br></br>
        Since these groups are managed automatically, we highly discourage manually adding/removing users to/from groups
        that are associated with trust levels.
