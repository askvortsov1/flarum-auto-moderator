        <li>Trust levels allow you to automatically manage group membership based on users' activity.</li>
        <li>Each trust level defines criteria that must be met (e.g. discussions started, posts made, etc), and a group.</li>
        <li>Users are automatically added to groups for all the trust levels that they qualify for when they log in.</li>
        <li>Since these groups are managed automatically, we recommend maintaining a separate set of groups for trust levels.</li>
        <li>If you delete a trust level, you should also delete the associated group; otherwise, users in that trust level will remain in that group.</li>
        <li>To prevent errors, you cannot update a trust level's group after it has been created.</li>
        <li>Any ranges left disabled will not be counted. If all ranges are disabled for a given trust level, ALL users will receive that level.</li>
